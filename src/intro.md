Spyglass is a solution to address the following common issues when searching the web.
* Do you add terms such as `reddit` or `wiki` to your searches to narrow it down?
* Do you skip over a full-page of ads before getting to your actual search results?
* Do you scroll past dozens of SEO spam pages to find the recipe/review/blog post you were looking for?
* Do you get frustrated with overzealous autocorrect on your search terms?
