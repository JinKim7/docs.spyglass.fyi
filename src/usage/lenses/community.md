# Community Lenses

Spyglass has a small community that has been building lenses for different topics.
You can check out the ones available to download by clicking on "Manage/install lenses"
from the menubar icon to open up the "Lens Manager" as seen below.

Community lenses are downloaded from [spyglass-search/lens-box](https://github.com/spyglass-search/lens-box).

From here, you can one-click install lenses and the crawler will happily go out and
start indexing.
