# Plugins

Spyglass supports loading WebAssembly (Wasm) modules as plugins. A limited rust API is provided to allow the plugins to interact with Spyglass. Note that plugins are in their early stages and the APIs will change over time. Please generate issues with any desired use cases or API requests.
