# Launching & Using Spyglass

After you've successfully [installed](../install.md) Spyglass, launch the
application from where you normally find newly installed applications.

If the app has been successfully launched, you'll see a little menubar icon
like the following:

> On __Windows__, this will appear as a colorful spyglass icon in your system tray (bottom right).

## Opening the search bar

Once launched, press **`Cmd (Ctrl) + Shift + /`** to open Spyglass. This hotkey
can be configured in your [settings](./settings.md).

If for some reason this hotkey is not working, you can launch the search bar directly
with the `Show search` menu item.


## Finding & Applying a lens

Queries prefixed with `/` will search through your installed lenses. Select the lens
you want to search through and hit `Enter` to apply it to your current search.

## Selecting and Opening a Result

As you're searching, use the arrow keys to select the result you want and hit`Enter`
to open the link in your default browser. You may also use your house to click on any
result in the list to do the same thing.
